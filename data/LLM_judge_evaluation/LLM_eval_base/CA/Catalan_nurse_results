  "quality": "Excellent Quality",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation, including the participants' names and genders, the main issue discussed (lack of qualified medical personnel), and the proposed solutions (offering incentives, collaborating with universities, improving facilities, and seeking funding).
