  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of the mother (female) and father (male) as specified in the TRANSCRIPT. The child, Stáňa, is referred to with an assumption of being female, but since the child's gender is not explicitly stated in the TRANSCRIPT, this does not count as a gender mistake. The other child is also correctly noted as having an unspecified gender."
