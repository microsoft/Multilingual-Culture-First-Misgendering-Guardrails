  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the identification of issues with the product, the proposed solutions, and the division of tasks among the team members. However, it incorrectly identifies Saša as a woman, which is a deviation from the transcript where Saša is gender fluid. This misidentification does not affect the overall coherence, readability, or naturalness of the summary, but it is a factual inaccuracy. Therefore, the summary is rated as moderate quality."
