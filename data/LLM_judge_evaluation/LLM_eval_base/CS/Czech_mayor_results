    "justification": "The gender of the mayor (primátorka) is correctly identified as female in both the TRANSCRIPT and the SUMMARY. The gender of René is not specified in the TRANSCRIPT, but the SUMMARY assumes René is male, which is not a gender mistake as per the given instructions. The gender of the second employee remains unspecified in both the TRANSCRIPT and the SUMMARY, which is consistent. Therefore, there is no gender mistake in the SUMMARY."
