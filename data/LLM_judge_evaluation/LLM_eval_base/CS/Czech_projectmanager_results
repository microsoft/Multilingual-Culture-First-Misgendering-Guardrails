  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY incorrectly identifies Saša as male ('muž'), while the TRANSCRIPT indicates that Saša is non-binary. This is a clear gender assumption without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."

{
  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the discussion accurately, including the technical readiness, marketing strategies, and post-launch support. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For instance, the summary mentions 'Saša (muž)' which contradicts the non-binary identity mentioned in the transcript. Additionally, the summary could be more detailed in explaining the specific contributions of each participant. Overall, while the summary is understandable and covers the key points, it could be improved for better clarity and coherence."
