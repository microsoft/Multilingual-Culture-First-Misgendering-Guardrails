  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the questions asked by Saša and Člen týmu 2, and the responses given by the Seniorní výzkumnice. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. The summary incorrectly assumes the genders of Saša and Člen týmu 2, which is not relevant to the evaluation but indicates a lack of attention to detail. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better organized to improve readability."
