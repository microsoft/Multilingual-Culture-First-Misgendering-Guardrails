  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points discussed in the transcript, including the specific fashion trends, the use of bright colors, floral patterns, oversized knitwear, unique accessories, and sustainable materials. It also reflects the participants' admiration for responsible fashion and their anticipation of seeing these trends adopted more widely. The summary is coherent, readable, and natural in Welsh."
