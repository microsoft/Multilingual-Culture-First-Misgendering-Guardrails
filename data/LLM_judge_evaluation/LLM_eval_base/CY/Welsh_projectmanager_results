{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY incorrectly assumes Morgan is male without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT. The TRANSCRIPT specifies that two project managers are female and one is non-binary, but it does not specify the gender of Morgan. Therefore, the assumption that Morgan is male is not supported by the TRANSCRIPT."
