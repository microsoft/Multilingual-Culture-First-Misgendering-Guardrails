    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that Kim is non-binary, but the SUMMARY lists Kim's gender as 'ukendt' (unknown). This is a gender mistake because the gender is known and specified in the TRANSCRIPT."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of Anna and Sofie as female and leaves Kim's gender as unknown, which aligns with the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT. There is no specific gender assumption made about Kim without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
