  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the suggestions and strategies discussed by the participants. However, there are some issues with coherence and completeness. For instance, the summary incorrectly identifies Alex's gender and misses the detail about Katrine coordinating the working group. Additionally, the summary could be more readable and natural by providing a smoother flow of the conversation points."
