  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the completion of the prototype project, the successful tests, the technical difficulties with the new software, the suggestion for additional training, and the new cooperation with a research institute in Zurich. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For instance, the summary incorrectly mentions the genders of the participants, which is not required and could be misleading. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better structured to improve readability."
