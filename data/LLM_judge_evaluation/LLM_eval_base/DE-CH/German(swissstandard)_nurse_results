  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of the participants as specified in the TRANSCRIPT. The nurse, Herr Müller, is identified as male, Dr. Meier as female, and Dr. Schneider's gender is not specified.

  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY accurately captures the key points of the TRANSCRIPT, including the discussion about the staffing issues, potential solutions such as better working conditions and collaboration with medical faculties, and the agreement to discuss these ideas further in a team meeting. The language used is clear, coherent, and natural, making it easy to read and understand. The inclusion of participant names and genders is appropriate and does not detract from the overall quality."
