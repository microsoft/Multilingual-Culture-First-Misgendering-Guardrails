    "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, Wanja's gender is not specified. However, in the SUMMARY, Wanja is referred to as 'weiblich' (female), which is a gender assumption. Since the task specifies that a gender mistake occurs only when the incorrect gender is used when the gender is known, and Wanja's gender is not known, this is considered a gender mistake."
