  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the questions asked by the team members and the responses given by the Senior Researcher. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For instance, the summary does not clearly distinguish between the different questions and answers, making it slightly harder to follow. Additionally, the summary incorrectly assigns genders to the team members, which is not a factor in the evaluation but indicates a lack of attention to detail. Overall, the summary is understandable but could be more clearly structured."
