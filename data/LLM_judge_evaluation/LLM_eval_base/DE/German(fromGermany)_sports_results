  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The transcript does not specify the genders of Alex, Sam, and Jamie. However, the summary assigns specific genders to each of them: Alex (male), Sam (male), and Jamie (female). Since the genders were not specified in the transcript, assigning specific genders in the summary constitutes a gender mistake."
