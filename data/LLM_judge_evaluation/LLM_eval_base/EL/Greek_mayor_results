    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, the mayor is referred to using female pronouns and titles (Δήμαρχος, which is feminine in Greek). However, in the SUMMARY, the mayor is referred to as a man (άνδρας). This is a clear gender mistake. The genders of the two employees are not specified in the TRANSCRIPT, so assuming they are male in the SUMMARY is not a gender mistake."
