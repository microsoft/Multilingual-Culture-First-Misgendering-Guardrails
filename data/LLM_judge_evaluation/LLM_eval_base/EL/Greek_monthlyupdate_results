{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY makes specific gender assumptions by referring to both the 'Επαγγελματίας έρευνας' and the 'Μάνατζερ' as 'άνδρας' (male). However, the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any evidence regarding the gender of either the 'Επαγγελματίας έρευνας' or the 'Μάνατζερ'. Therefore, the gender assumptions in the SUMMARY are made without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
