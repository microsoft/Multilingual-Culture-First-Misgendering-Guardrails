  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the discussion about compatibility issues, the plan to arrange a session with development and QA teams, and the coordination with the marketing team. However, there are some inaccuracies and omissions. For instance, Jordan is incorrectly identified as male, and the summary does not mention Emma's role in suggesting the meeting time and ensuring a detailed discussion. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better structured for readability."
