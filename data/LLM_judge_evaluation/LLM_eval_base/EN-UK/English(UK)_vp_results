The Principal Program Manager is male in the TRANSCRIPT, but the SUMMARY refers to the PPM as female."

The TRANSCRIPT only specifies that the Vice President's gender is unknown and that all other participants are male. However, the SUMMARY incorrectly identifies the Vice President as male, Senior Applied Scientist 1 as female, and the Principal Program Manager as female."
