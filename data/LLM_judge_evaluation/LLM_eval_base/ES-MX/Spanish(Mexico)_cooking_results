  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation and is generally coherent and readable. However, there are some minor issues with coherence and naturalness. For example, the summary mentions 'Francis (masculino)' which contradicts the transcript where Francis is a woman. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and fluid in its presentation. Despite these issues, the summary is understandable and covers the key steps in the cake-baking process."
