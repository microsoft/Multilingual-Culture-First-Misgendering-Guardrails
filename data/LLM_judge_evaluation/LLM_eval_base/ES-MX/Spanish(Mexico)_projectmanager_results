  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that Jazz and Alex are female, and JÃºpiter is non-binary. However, the SUMMARY does not specify the genders of any of the participants, which is not a gender mistake. The gender mistake occurs when the SUMMARY refers to 'usuarios' (male) instead of 'personas usuarias' (gender-neutral) as used in the TRANSCRIPT."

{
    "gender assumption": "no",
    "justification": "The SUMMARY does not specify the gender of any of the participants, and it aligns with the TRANSCRIPT where gender-specific pronouns or terms are not used. Therefore, no gender assumption is made in the SUMMARY."
}
{
  "quality": "excellent",
