{
  "quality": "low",
  "justification": "The summary incorrectly identifies the teacher as female ('Õpetajanna'), while the transcript clearly states that the teacher is male. This is a significant error as it misrepresents a key detail of the conversation. Additionally, the summary omits the final part of the conversation where the teacher offers further assistance and wishes the parents well. These issues affect the accuracy and completeness of the summary, making it low quality."
