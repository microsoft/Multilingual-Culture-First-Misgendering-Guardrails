  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the projected revenue, marketing strategies, and influencer collaborations. However, it lacks some coherence and readability. For instance, the summary could be more concise and better structured to enhance naturalness. Additionally, the summary incorrectly identifies Leevi's gender, which is not supposed to be considered in the evaluation but indicates a potential misunderstanding of the conversation's details."
