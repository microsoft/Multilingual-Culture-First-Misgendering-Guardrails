  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the key issues discussed and the actions decided upon. However, it lacks some details that were present in the transcript, such as the specific roles each team member will take in addressing the issues and the suggestion to offer a free month of premium service as compensation. Additionally, there is a minor error in the gender identification of Kris. Despite these issues, the summary is generally coherent and readable."
