{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY assigns a female gender to Siiri and Marika without any evidence from the TRANSCRIPT. The TRANSCRIPT only specifies that the Vice President's gender is unknown and that the other participants are male. Therefore, the assumption about Siiri and Marika being female is not supported by the TRANSCRIPT."

  "quality": "excellent",

The main ideas discussed, such as the AI-based recommendation system, technical analysis, pilot project, and coordination of resources, are all clearly mentioned. The summary also correctly identifies the roles and contributions of each participant, making it a high-quality output."
