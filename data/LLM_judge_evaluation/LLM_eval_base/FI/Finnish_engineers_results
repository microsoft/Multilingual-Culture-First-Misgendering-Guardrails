  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of Laura and Sanni as female and does not assign a specific gender to Myrsky, who is gender fluid. This matches the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT, where Laura and Sanni are referred to with female pronouns and Myrsky's gender is acknowledged as important but not specifically defined. Therefore, there is no gender mistake in the SUMMARY."
