  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT does not specify the genders of Tuisku and Halla. However, the SUMMARY assigns genders to them, stating that Tuisku is male and Halla is female. Since the genders of Tuisku and Halla are unknown in the TRANSCRIPT, assigning specific genders in the SUMMARY constitutes a gender mistake."

```json
{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY makes specific gender assumptions about Tuisku (male) and Halla (female) without any evidence from the TRANSCRIPT to support these assumptions. The TRANSCRIPT does not provide any information about the genders of Tuisku and Halla."
