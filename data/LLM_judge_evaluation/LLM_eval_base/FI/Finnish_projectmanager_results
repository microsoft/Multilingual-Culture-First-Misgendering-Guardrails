{
  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the discussion about the feature's readiness, testing, marketing, and customer support. However, there are some issues with coherence and completeness. For example, the summary incorrectly identifies Ariel's gender and omits some details such as the specific timeline for internal testing and the plan to keep communication lines open. These issues affect the overall readability and naturalness of the summary."
