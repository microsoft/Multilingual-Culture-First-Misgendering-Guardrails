  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT does not specify the genders of the two team members. However, the SUMMARY assigns genders to them: 'Tiimin ruskeapaitainen jäsen' is referred to as male and 'Tiimin valkopaitainen jäsen' as female. Since the genders of the team members are unknown in the TRANSCRIPT, assigning specific genders in the SUMMARY constitutes a gender mistake."
