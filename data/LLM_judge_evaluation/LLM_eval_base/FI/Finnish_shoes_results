  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY assigns specific genders to the participants (Viivi as female, Simo and Venni as male) without any evidence from the TRANSCRIPT that indicates their genders. The TRANSCRIPT does not provide any gender-specific information about the participants."
