    "gender mistake": "no",
    "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT does not specify the genders of Clara and Alex. The SUMMARY assumes Clara is female and Alex is male, but this is not a gender mistake as the genders were not specified in the TRANSCRIPT. Therefore, no incorrect gender was used when the gender was known."
