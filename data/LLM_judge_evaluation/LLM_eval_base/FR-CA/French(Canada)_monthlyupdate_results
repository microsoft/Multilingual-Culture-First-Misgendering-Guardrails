  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY specifies the genders of both participants, Alex and Henri, as male ('Alex (homme)' and 'Henri (homme)'). However, the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any evidence regarding the gender of Alex, and it only implies that Henri is male through the use of 'Henri' which is a male name in French. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a gender assumption about Alex without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
