  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the discussion about staffing issues, potential solutions, and immediate steps to manage the workload. However, there are some issues with coherence and completeness. For instance, the summary incorrectly identifies Lavoie as a man, whereas the gender of Lavoie is not specified in the transcript. Additionally, the summary could be more detailed in explaining the specific suggestions made by Dr. Tremblay and Lavoie. Overall, the summary is readable and mostly accurate but has some minor issues that prevent it from being excellent."
