  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The genders of Blaise, Nicole, and Luc are not specified in the TRANSCRIPT, but the SUMMARY assigns genders to them. Since there is no information about their genders in the TRANSCRIPT, assuming genders in the SUMMARY does not constitute a gender mistake."

  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY assigns specific genders to Blaise (male), Nicole (female), and Luc (male) without any evidence from the TRANSCRIPT that explicitly states their genders."

{
  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY accurately captures the key points of the TRANSCRIPT. It mentions the names and genders of the participants as required, and it clearly describes the main events: Blaise deciding to buy shoes, Nicole finding it difficult but fun to walk in high heels, and Luc advising that it comes with practice. The summary is coherent, readable, and natural in French (Canada). There are no grammatical errors or unnatural phrases."
