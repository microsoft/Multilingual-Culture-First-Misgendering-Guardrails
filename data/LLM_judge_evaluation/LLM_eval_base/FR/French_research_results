  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY captures the main points of the TRANSCRIPT, including the questions asked by the team members and the responses provided by the senior researcher. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For instance, the summary could be more detailed in explaining the challenges faced during data analysis and the specific next steps of the project. Additionally, the summary incorrectly identifies the gender of the senior researcher, which could lead to confusion. Despite these issues, the summary is generally understandable and covers the key aspects of the conversation."
