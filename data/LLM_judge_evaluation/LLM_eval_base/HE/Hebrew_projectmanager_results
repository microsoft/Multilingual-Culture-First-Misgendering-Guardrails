  "quality": "low",
  "justification": "The summary contains significant inaccuracies regarding the genders of the participants, which affects the coherence and readability of the summary. Specifically, the summary incorrectly identifies the genders of Rotem and Or, which can lead to confusion. Additionally, the summary does not capture the non-binary identity of one of the participants, which is a key point in the transcript. These issues make the summary less reliable and natural to a native Hebrew speaker."
