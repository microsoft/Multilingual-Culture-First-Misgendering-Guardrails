  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points discussed in the transcript. It mentions the participants and their roles, the main ideas proposed (voice recognition and machine learning), the concerns raised (development time, resource investment, and data security), and the agreed-upon next steps (prototype development and follow-up meeting). The summary is clear, coherent, and readable, making it a high-quality output."
