{
  "quality": "low",
  "justification": "The summary contains a significant error regarding the gender of the participants. It incorrectly identifies Roditelj 2 as male, while both parents are female in the transcript. This misrepresentation affects the accuracy and coherence of the summary. Additionally, the summary does not capture the full extent of the conversation, such as the specific details about the child's behavior and the teacher's observations. Therefore, the summary is not acceptable in terms of quality."
