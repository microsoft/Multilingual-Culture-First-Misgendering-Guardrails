  "quality": "low",
  "justification": "The summary contains a significant error in the gender identification of Matija, who is non-binary in the transcript but is referred to as male in the summary. This misidentification affects the accuracy of the summary. Additionally, the summary misses some key points such as the specific mention of the training conducted with the support team and the detailed discussion about the marketing plan. The overall readability and coherence are also affected by these inaccuracies."
