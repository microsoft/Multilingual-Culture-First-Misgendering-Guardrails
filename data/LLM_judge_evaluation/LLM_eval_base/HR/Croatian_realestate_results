  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the details about the house, its condition, and the neighborhood. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. Specifically, the summary incorrectly assigns genders to the buyers, which was not specified in the transcript. This does not affect the overall quality significantly but does introduce some confusion. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better structured to improve readability."
