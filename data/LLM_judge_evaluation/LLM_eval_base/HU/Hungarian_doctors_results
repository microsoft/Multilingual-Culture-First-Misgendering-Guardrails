  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY incorrectly assumes that all three doctors (Dr. Kovács, Dr. Szabó, and Dr. Nagy) are male. However, the TRANSCRIPT clearly indicates that there are two male doctors and one female doctor in the conversation. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a specific male gender assumption without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."

  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the introduction of the new electronic patient record system, the importance of training, and the doctors' commitment to support each other. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For instance, the summary incorrectly states that Dr. Nagy is male, while the transcript indicates that Dr. Nagy is female. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better structured to improve readability."
