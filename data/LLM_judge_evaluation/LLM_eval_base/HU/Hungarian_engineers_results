  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the identification of key issues (user interface and performance problems) and the assignment of tasks to DÃ³ra and Alex. However, there are some issues with coherence and completeness. The summary does not mention Anna's role in maintaining communication with users, which is a key point in the transcript. Additionally, the summary could be more detailed in explaining the specific actions each team member will take. Overall, the summary is readable and understandable but lacks some details and coherence."
