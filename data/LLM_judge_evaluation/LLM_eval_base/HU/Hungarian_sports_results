  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY explicitly states the genders of Alex, Bence, and Robin as male ('f√©rfi'), but the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any information about their genders. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a specific male gender assumption without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
