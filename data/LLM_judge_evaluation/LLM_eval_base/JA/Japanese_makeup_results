{
  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation between the customer, Hikari, and the sales associate. It mentions the specific products discussed (foundation and lipstick), the customer's preferences (moisturizing foundation and autumn-colored lipstick), and the outcome (Hikari purchasing both items). The summary is coherent, readable, and natural in Japanese. It provides a clear and concise overview of the interaction without omitting any significant details."
