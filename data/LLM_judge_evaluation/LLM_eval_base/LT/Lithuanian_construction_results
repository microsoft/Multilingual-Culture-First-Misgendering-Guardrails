  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the tasks assigned to each worker and the emphasis on safety. However, there are some issues with coherence and accuracy. For example, the summary incorrectly states that Patrikas will check the materials list, while in the transcript, Patrikas mentions he will handle documentation and drawings. Additionally, the summary lists Alex as a man, which is not specified in the transcript. These inaccuracies affect the overall quality and coherence of the summary."
