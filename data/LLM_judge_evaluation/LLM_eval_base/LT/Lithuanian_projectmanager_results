  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the roles and contributions of each participant. However, there are some inaccuracies and omissions. For example, the summary incorrectly identifies Dovydė as a man, which is not relevant to the quality but indicates a lack of attention to detail. Additionally, the summary does not mention the specific issues discussed, such as the need for real user testing scenarios and the specific marketing messages. The overall readability and coherence are acceptable, but the summary could be more detailed and precise."
