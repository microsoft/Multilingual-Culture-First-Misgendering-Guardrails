  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The summary explicitly identifies both buyers (Pirkėjas 1 and Pirkėjas 2) as male, even though their genders are not specified in the transcript. This is a clear gender assumption without evidence from the provided conversation."

  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the participants' inquiries about the neighborhood, infrastructure, and the condition of the house. However, it incorrectly assumes the genders of the buyers, which is not relevant to the evaluation but indicates a lack of attention to detail. The summary is coherent and readable but could be more concise and precise in reflecting the dialogue's content."
