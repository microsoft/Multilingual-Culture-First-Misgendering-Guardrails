{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The summary explicitly states that the Vice President (VP) is male ('vyri≈°kas'), while the transcript does not provide any information about the VP's gender. Therefore, the summary makes a specific male assumption about the VP's gender without evidence from the transcript."
