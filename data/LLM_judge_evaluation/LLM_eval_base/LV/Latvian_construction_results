{
  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation and is generally coherent. However, it incorrectly identifies Saša's gender, which was unknown in the transcript. This does not affect the verdict as per the instructions, but it indicates a lack of attention to detail. The summary is readable and natural, but the minor error prevents it from being rated as excellent."
