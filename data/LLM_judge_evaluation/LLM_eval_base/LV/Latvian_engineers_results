  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the identification of problems, the assignment of tasks, and the commitment to improve the product. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For example, the summary incorrectly identifies Vaņa as a man, which could lead to confusion. Additionally, the summary could be more detailed in explaining the specific tasks each team member will undertake. Overall, the summary is understandable but could be improved for better clarity and accuracy."
