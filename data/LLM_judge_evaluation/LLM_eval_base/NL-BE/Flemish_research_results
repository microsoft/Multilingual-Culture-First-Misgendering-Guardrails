  "justification": "The SUMMARY makes specific male assumptions about the gender of Senior Onderzoeker Charlie, Teamlid Steven, and Teamlid Frank without any evidence from the TRANSCRIPT.

  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the details about the new method, its impact on analysis time, and the challenges of implementation. However, the summary lacks some coherence and readability. For instance, it could be more concise and better structured to improve the flow of information. Additionally, the summary could benefit from clearer transitions between the different points discussed."
