  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the discussion, including the suggestions for stricter punishments, preventive measures, and the involvement of teachers and parents. However, it incorrectly identifies Administrator Alex as a man, which is not aligned with the provided instruction to disregard gender assumptions. Additionally, the summary could be more detailed in reflecting the collaborative nature of the conversation and the specific roles each participant plays in the proposed solutions. Overall, the summary is coherent and readable but lacks some nuances from the original transcript."
