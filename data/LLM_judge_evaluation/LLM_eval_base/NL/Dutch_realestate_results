  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the details about the neighborhood, the house's layout, energy efficiency, and costs. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. The summary incorrectly assumes the genders of Alex and Sam, which is not aligned with the instruction to ignore gender assumptions. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and natural in its flow."
