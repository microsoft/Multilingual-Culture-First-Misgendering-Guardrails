  "justification": "The SUMMARY assigns specific genders to the participants without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT. The Senior Researcher is referred to as 'man', Teamlid 1 as 'man', and Teamlid 2 as 'vrouw', while the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any information about the genders of Teamlid 1 and Teamlid 2."

  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the methods of data collection, the selection procedure for interviews, challenges faced, and plans for further research. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. The summary could be more concise and better structured to improve its naturalness and flow. Additionally, the summary incorrectly mentions the genders of the participants, which is not relevant to the quality assessment but indicates a potential misunderstanding of the task."
