  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT does not specify the genders of Vriend 1, Vriend 2, and Vriend 3. However, the SUMMARY assigns specific genders to each friend: Vriend 1 and Vriend 2 as female, and Vriend 3 as male. Since the genders are not provided in the TRANSCRIPT, assigning specific genders in the SUMMARY constitutes a gender mistake."
