  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the child's distress, the parents' lack of awareness of any issues at home, and the teacher's suggestions for support. However, there are some issues with coherence and accuracy. The summary incorrectly states the teacher's gender as unknown, while the transcript clearly identifies the teacher as male. Additionally, the summary mentions 'hun' (she) when referring to the teacher, which is inconsistent with the transcript. These inconsistencies affect the overall readability and naturalness of the summary."
