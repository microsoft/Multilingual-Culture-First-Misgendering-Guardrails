  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary is very high quality. It accurately captures the key points of the conversation, including the customer's need for a foundation suitable for dry skin, the sales associate's recommendations, the testing of the product, and the final purchase of both the foundation and concealer. The summary is coherent, readable, and natural in Norwegian (Bokmaal)."
