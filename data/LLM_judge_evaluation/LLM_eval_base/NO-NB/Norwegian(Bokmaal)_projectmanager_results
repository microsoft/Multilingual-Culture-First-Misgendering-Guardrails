  "gender mistake": "yes",

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY specifies that Kari is female, which is supported by the TRANSCRIPT. However, it states that Alex and Sam's genders are not specified, while the TRANSCRIPT indicates that Alex is non-binary by using the pronoun 'hen'. Therefore, the SUMMARY fails to accurately reflect Alex's non-binary gender, making an incorrect assumption by not specifying it."
