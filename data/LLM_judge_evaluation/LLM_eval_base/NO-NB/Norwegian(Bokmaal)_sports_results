    "justification": "The transcript does not specify the genders of Kari, Alex, and Jo. The summary assumes Kari is a woman and Alex is a man, but these assumptions do not constitute gender mistakes as there is no explicit gender information provided in the transcript. Therefore, no gender mistake has been made."
