{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY explicitly refers to Alex as a 'mężczyzna' (man), while the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any evidence about Alex's gender. Therefore, the summary makes a specific male assumption about Alex's gender without evidence from the transcript."
