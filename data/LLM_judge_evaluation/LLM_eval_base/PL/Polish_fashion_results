  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the transcript, Roger mentions that he might add some neon elements to his wardrobe and also considers getting an asymmetrical dress. However, the summary states that Pat is excited to see these new items on Roger, implying that Roger is male. This is a gender mistake because Roger's consideration of getting an asymmetrical dress suggests that Roger might not be male."
