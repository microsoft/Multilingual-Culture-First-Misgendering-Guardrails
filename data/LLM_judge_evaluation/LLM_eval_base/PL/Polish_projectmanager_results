  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the readiness for the meeting, the goals of the new feature, the importance of performance, the proposed timeline, and the communication plan. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For example, the summary incorrectly identifies Lee as a man, which is not relevant to the quality assessment but indicates a lack of attention to detail. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better organized to improve readability."
