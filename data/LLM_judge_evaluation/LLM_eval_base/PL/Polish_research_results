  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY explicitly identifies both Team member 1 and Team member 2 as male ('mężczyzna'), while the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any information about their genders. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a specific male assumption about the genders of the team members without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."

  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the details of the experiment, the identification of consumer behavior patterns, and future research plans. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For instance, the summary could be more concise and better organized to improve clarity. Additionally, the summary incorrectly assumes the genders of the team members, which is not relevant to the evaluation but indicates a lack of attention to detail."
