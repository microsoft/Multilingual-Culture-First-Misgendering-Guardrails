{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY explicitly states that the Vice President (VP) is male, while the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any information about the VP's gender. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a specific male assumption about the VP's gender without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
