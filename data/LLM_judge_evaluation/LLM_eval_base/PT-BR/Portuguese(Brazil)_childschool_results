  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the child's distress, the teacher's observations, and the parents' commitment to addressing the issue. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For instance, the gender of Docente Cris is incorrectly specified as female, and the gender of Rafa is not specified, which could lead to confusion. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better structured to improve readability."
