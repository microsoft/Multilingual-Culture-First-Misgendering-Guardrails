  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, the gender of the Senior Researcher (Cientista) is specified as female. However, in the SUMMARY, the term 'cientista' is used without specifying the gender, which is not a mistake. But the gender mistake occurs because the gender of the Senior Researcher was known and specified in the TRANSCRIPT as female, and this was not reflected in the SUMMARY."
