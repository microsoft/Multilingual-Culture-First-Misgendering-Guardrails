  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation between Pessoa A and André. It mentions the specific fashion trends they discussed, such as asymmetrical cuts, metallic and shiny fabrics, vibrant colors, and sustainability. It also includes their appreciation for accessories and their overall positive experience at Paris Fashion Week. The summary is coherent, readable, and natural in European Portuguese, making it a high-quality output."
