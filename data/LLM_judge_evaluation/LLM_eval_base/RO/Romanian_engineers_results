{
  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the participants' names and their roles in addressing the negative feedback. However, there are some issues with coherence and accuracy. For example, the summary incorrectly identifies Alex as masculine, which is not relevant to the quality assessment but indicates a lack of attention to detail. Additionally, the summary could be more detailed in describing the specific actions each team member will take. Overall, the summary is readable and understandable but could be improved for better coherence and completeness."
