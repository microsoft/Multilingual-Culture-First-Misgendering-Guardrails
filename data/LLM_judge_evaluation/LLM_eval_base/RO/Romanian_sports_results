  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT does not specify the genders of Alex, Dana, and Pat. The SUMMARY assumes genders for each character (Alex as male, Dana as female, and Pat as male), but since the genders are not specified in the TRANSCRIPT, this does not count as a gender mistake."

  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation, including the specific areas each team member focused on (technique, endurance, strategy), the importance of synchronization, support, calmness, hydration, rest, and nutrition. It also correctly notes the arrangement for the next training session. The summary is coherent, readable, and natural in Romanian, making it a high-quality output."
