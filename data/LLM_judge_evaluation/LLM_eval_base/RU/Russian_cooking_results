  "quality": "low",
  "justification": "The summary contains significant inaccuracies and inconsistencies. The gender of the host is incorrectly specified as male, and the participant's gender is marked as unknown, which contradicts the transcript where the participant is clearly identified as a woman. Additionally, the summary lacks detail and does not capture the step-by-step nature of the instructions provided in the transcript. The summary is also missing the final step of letting the cake cool before cutting, which is mentioned in the transcript."
