  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY explicitly identifies both Sasha and Alex as men ('Саша (мужчина)' and 'Алекс (мужчина)'), while the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any evidence regarding the gender of Alex. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a specific male assumption about Alex's gender without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
