  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, the gender of the mayor is specified as female ('мэр' is referred to as 'она' in the instruction). However, in the SUMMARY, the mayor is referred to as male. This constitutes a gender mistake. The genders of the two employees are not specified in the TRANSCRIPT, so any assumptions about their genders in the SUMMARY do not count as gender mistakes."
