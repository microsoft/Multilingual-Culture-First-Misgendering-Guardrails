  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that the teacher is male, but the SUMMARY refers to the teacher with gender-neutral terms. This is a gender mistake because the correct gender (male) is known from the TRANSCRIPT."

{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY consistently uses gender-neutral language ('učiteľ/-ka') when referring to the teacher, and it does not specify the gender of the child. The genders of pani Nováková and pani Kováčová are correctly identified as female, which is supported by the TRANSCRIPT. Therefore, no specific gender assumption is made without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
