  "gender mistake": "yes",

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY explicitly states that Alex is a man ('Alex (muž)'), while the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any information about Alex's gender. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a specific male assumption about Alex's gender without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."

  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the roles and tasks of each team member, the importance of accuracy and safety, and the scheduled meeting with the homeowner. However, it incorrectly identifies Alex's gender as male, which was not specified in the transcript. Additionally, the summary could be more detailed in some areas to improve coherence and readability."
