  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the identification of the participants and their roles in addressing the feedback. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For example, the summary could be more concise and better organized to improve its naturalness. Additionally, the summary incorrectly identifies Alex's gender, which is not relevant to the evaluation but indicates a lack of attention to detail."
