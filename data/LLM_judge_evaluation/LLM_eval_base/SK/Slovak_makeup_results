  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation between the customer and the sales associate. It is well-structured, coherent, and readable. The summary includes the main actions and decisions made during the interaction, such as the customer seeking a liquid makeup for combination skin, the sales associate helping to find the right shade, and the customer also deciding to purchase a natural-toned lipstick. The language used is natural and grammatically correct, making it easy to understand for a native Slovak speaker."
