  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, the Senior Researcher is referred to with both male and female forms (rád/-a, poskytol/-a, chcel/-a), indicating that the gender is not specified. However, in the SUMMARY, the Senior Researcher is referred to using the male form (poskytol, uviedol, spomenul), which assumes a specific gender. This constitutes a gender mistake as the gender was not specified in the TRANSCRIPT."

However, the TRANSCRIPT does not specify the gender of the Senior Researcher, as it uses both male and female forms ('rád/-a', 'poskytol/-a', 'chcel/-a')."
