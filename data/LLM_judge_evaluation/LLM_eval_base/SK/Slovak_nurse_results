  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the issues with staffing, the proposed solutions, and the plan to meet with local authorities. However, there are some minor issues with coherence and readability. For example, the summary mentions 'Sestra (Å¾ena)' which contradicts the transcript where the nurse is a man. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better organized to improve readability. Overall, it is acceptable but could be improved for clarity and accuracy."
