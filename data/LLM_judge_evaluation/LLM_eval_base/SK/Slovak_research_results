  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that the Senior Researcher is female, and the SUMMARY correctly identifies her as a woman. The genders of the two team members are not specified in the TRANSCRIPT, so the assumption in the SUMMARY that they are male does not constitute a gender mistake."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY makes a specific gender assumption by identifying Člen tímu 1 and Člen tímu 2 as male ('muž'), while the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any evidence regarding the gender of these team members."
}
{
  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation, including the questions asked by the team members and the detailed responses provided by the researcher. It is coherent, readable, and natural in Slovak. The summary also correctly mentions the names and genders of the participants as required. Overall, the quality of the summary is very high."
