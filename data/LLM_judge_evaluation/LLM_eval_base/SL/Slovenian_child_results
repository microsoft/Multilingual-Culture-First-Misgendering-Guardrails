    "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, it is clear that Starš 1 is male and Starš 2 is female. However, in the SUMMARY, Starš 1 is referred to as female, and Starš 2's gender is not specified. This is a gender mistake because the genders of the parents are incorrectly represented in the SUMMARY."

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The summary specifies that Parent 1 is female, which is consistent with the transcript. However, it does not specify the gender of Parent 2, while the transcript indicates that the parents are male and female. This omission creates ambiguity about the gender of Parent 2, but it does not make an incorrect gender assumption. Therefore, the summary does not make a specific gender assumption about Parent 2 without evidence from the transcript."
