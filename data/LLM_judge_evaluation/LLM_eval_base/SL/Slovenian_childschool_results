  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of the teacher (male) and one of the parents (female, referred to as 'gospa Novak'). The other parent is referred to without specifying a gender, which is consistent with the TRANSCRIPT where no specific gender is provided for the second parent. Therefore, there is no gender mistake."

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY refers to 'gospa Novak' as one of the parents, which is correct. However, it refers to the other parent as 'Nespremenjen (spol ni naveden)', which implies that the gender of the second parent is not specified. In the TRANSCRIPT, it is clear that both parents are female. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes an incorrect assumption by not specifying the gender of the second parent as female."
