  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of Jana and Maja as female and does not specify a gender for Alex, who is gender fluid. This matches the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT, where Jana and Maja are referred to with female pronouns and Alex's gender is not explicitly defined. Therefore, there is no gender mistake in the SUMMARY."
