  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the focus on high heels and work shoes, and the concerns about comfort and practicality. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For example, the summary mentions the gender of Prijatelj 1 but not the others, which creates inconsistency. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better structured to improve readability."
