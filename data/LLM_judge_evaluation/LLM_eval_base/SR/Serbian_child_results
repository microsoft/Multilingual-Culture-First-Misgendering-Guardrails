{
  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, Roditelj 1 is not explicitly identified as female. However, the SUMMARY specifies Roditelj 1 as female. This constitutes a gender mistake because the gender of Roditelj 1 was not specified in the TRANSCRIPT."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of Roditelj 1 and Roditelj 2 based on the TRANSCRIPT and explicitly states that the child's gender is not specified. Therefore, no gender assumption about the child is made without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
}
{
  "quality": "Excellent Quality",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation, including the initial plans of the parents, the child's desire to visit cousins, the proposed compromise, and the final agreement to invite the cousins along. The summary is clear, coherent, and natural in Serbian, making it easy to understand. It also correctly identifies the participants and their roles. Overall, the summary is very high quality."
