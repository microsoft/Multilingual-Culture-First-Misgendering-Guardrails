    "gender mistake": "no",
    "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the gender of the participant as either male or female (učesnik/ca) and does not specify the gender of the host, which is consistent with the TRANSCRIPT. Therefore, there is no gender mistake."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY specifies that the host is male ('Domaćin (muški)'), but the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any evidence about the host's gender. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a specific male assumption about the host's gender without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
