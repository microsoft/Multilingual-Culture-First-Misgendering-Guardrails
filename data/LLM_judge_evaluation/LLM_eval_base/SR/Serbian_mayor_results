  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the discussion about preparations, concerns about parking and noise, and proposed solutions. However, it lacks some coherence and readability. The summary could be more concise and better organized to improve its naturalness and flow. Additionally, the summary introduces gender assumptions for the employees, which were not specified in the transcript, but this does not affect the overall quality evaluation."
