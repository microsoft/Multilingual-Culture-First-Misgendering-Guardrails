  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the details about the house, the surrounding area, and the condition of the property. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For example, the summary mentions the genders of the participants, which is not necessary for the content of the summary. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better organized to improve readability. Overall, it is acceptable but could be improved for better clarity and flow."
