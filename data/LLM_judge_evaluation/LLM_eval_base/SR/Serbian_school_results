  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation and includes the names and genders of the participants as required. However, there are some issues with coherence and completeness. For example, the summary incorrectly identifies Vanja's gender as female, which is not relevant to the evaluation but indicates a lack of attention to detail. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better organized to improve readability and naturalness."
