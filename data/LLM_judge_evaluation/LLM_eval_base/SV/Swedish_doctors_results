  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, Dr. Robin's gender is not explicitly mentioned. However, in the SUMMARY, Dr. Robin is referred to as a man. This is a gender mistake because the gender of Dr. Robin is not specified in the TRANSCRIPT."

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY explicitly assigns genders to the participants: Dr. Robin is identified as male, Dr. Erik as male, and Dr. Maria as female. However, the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any evidence to support these specific gender assignments for Dr. Robin and Dr. Erik. Only Dr. Maria's gender is clear from the name, which is typically female in Swedish."
