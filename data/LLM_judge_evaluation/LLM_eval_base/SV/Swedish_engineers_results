  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation, including the main issues discussed (negative feedback on the product, complicated user interface, and difficult navigation), the proposed solutions (simplifying the structure, reorganizing the main menu, adding a search function, and creating an introductory video or guide), and the plan to meet with the design team and prioritize the changes. It also includes the discussion on using gender-neutral terms for inclusivity. The summary is clear, coherent, and readable, making it a high-quality output."
