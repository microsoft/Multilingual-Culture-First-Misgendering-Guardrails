  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary is very high quality. It accurately captures the key points of the conversation, including the focus areas of each team member (Robin on conditioning, Casey on technique, and Alex on strength training), their discussion about team strategy, and their agreement to include more teamwork exercises. The summary is coherent, readable, and natural in Swedish. It also correctly mentions the names and genders of the participants as required."
