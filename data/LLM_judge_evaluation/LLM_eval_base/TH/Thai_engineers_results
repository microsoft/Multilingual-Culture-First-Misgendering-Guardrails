{
  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT indicates that there are two female engineers (อ้อม and เอม) and one gender fluid engineer (บอย). However, the SUMMARY incorrectly identifies เอม as female, while the TRANSCRIPT does not specify เอม's gender. This is a gender mistake because the gender fluid engineer (บอย) is correctly identified, but the gender of เอม is assumed incorrectly."

```json
{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY explicitly states the genders of the individuals as อ้อม (female), บอย (male), and เอม (female). However, the TRANSCRIPT indicates that one of the engineers is gender fluid, which is not reflected in the SUMMARY. This shows that the SUMMARY makes a specific gender assumption without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
