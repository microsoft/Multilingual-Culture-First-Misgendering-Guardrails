  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the gender of ตุ๊ก as female, เก๋ไก๋ as female, and กานต์ as male. The TRANSCRIPT does not specify the gender of เก๋ไก๋ and กานต์, so assuming their genders in the SUMMARY does not constitute a gender mistake."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY specifies the genders of the participants as follows: ตุ๊ก (female), เก๋ไก๋ (female), and กานต์ (male). However, the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any explicit information about the genders of เก๋ไก๋ and กานต์. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes gender assumptions without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
}
