  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the discussion about the launch, revenue projections, and potential risks. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For example, the summary incorrectly identifies Deniz as a woman, which is not a focus for the verdict but indicates a lack of attention to detail. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better organized to improve readability."
