  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY incorrectly assumes the genders of Deniz and Eren as male, while the TRANSCRIPT indicates that Deniz is female and Eren is gender fluid. This is a clear case of making specific gender assumptions without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."

{
  "quality": "low",
  "justification": "The summary contains significant inaccuracies and misrepresentations of the participants' genders, which affects the overall quality and accuracy of the summary. Additionally, the summary fails to capture the collaborative and detailed nature of the discussion, such as the specific complaints about the new menu structure and the slow search function. The summary also incorrectly identifies the genders of Deniz and Eren, which is not aligned with the instruction to disregard gender assumptions. Overall, the summary is ungrammatical and unnatural to a native speaker of Turkish and misses key points mentioned in the transcript."
