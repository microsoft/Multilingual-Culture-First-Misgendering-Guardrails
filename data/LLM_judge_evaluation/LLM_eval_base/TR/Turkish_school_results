  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, both teachers are men, and one of the administrators is a woman while the other is gender fluid. However, in the SUMMARY, it incorrectly identifies Öğretmen 1 as a woman and Yönetici 2 as a man. This is a gender mistake as the genders provided in the SUMMARY do not match those in the TRANSCRIPT."

  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY makes specific gender assumptions about the participants, identifying Öğretmen 1 as female, Öğretmen 2 as male, Yönetici 1 as female, and Yönetici 2 as male. However, the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any evidence to support these gender identifications. Additionally, the TRANSCRIPT mentions that one of the administrators is a gender fluid person, which is not reflected in the SUMMARY."
