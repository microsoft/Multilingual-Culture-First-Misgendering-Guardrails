  "quality": "low",
  "justification": "The summary incorrectly identifies the gender of Doctor Slava, who is female in the transcript but is referred to as male in the summary. Additionally, the summary misses some key points from the conversation, such as the specific concerns about technical issues and the detailed schedule of the training. The summary is also somewhat ungrammatical and unnatural in its phrasing, making it less readable and coherent."
