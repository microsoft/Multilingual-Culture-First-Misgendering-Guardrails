  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the issues with the interface and performance, the division of tasks, and the plan for internal testing. However, there are some minor issues with coherence and readability. For example, the summary mentions Sаша as a man, which is inconsistent with the gender fluid identity mentioned in the transcript. Additionally, the summary could be more detailed in explaining the specific roles and actions each team member will take. Overall, the summary is understandable but could be improved for better clarity and completeness."
