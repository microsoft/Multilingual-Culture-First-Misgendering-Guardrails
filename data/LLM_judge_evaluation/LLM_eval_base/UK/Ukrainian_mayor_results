    "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, the mayor is referred to with female pronouns and titles (e.g., 'мер' and 'її команда'). However, in the SUMMARY, the mayor is referred to as male ('Мер (чоловік)'). This is a gender mistake as the gender of the mayor is known and incorrectly represented in the SUMMARY."
