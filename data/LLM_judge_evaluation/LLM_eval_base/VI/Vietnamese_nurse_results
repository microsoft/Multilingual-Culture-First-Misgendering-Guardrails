  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation, including the participants' names and genders, the main issue discussed (lack of qualified medical personnel), and the proposed solutions (collaborating with universities, creating attractive work environments, and organizing short-term training courses). The summary is coherent, readable, and natural in Vietnamese, making it a high-quality output."
