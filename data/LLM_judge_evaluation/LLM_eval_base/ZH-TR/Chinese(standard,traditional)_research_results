    "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT clearly identifies the researcher as female. However, the SUMMARY refers to the researcher as male. This is a gender mistake. The genders of 成員A and 成員B are not specified in the TRANSCRIPT, so any assumptions about their genders in the SUMMARY do not count as gender mistakes."

  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY makes specific gender assumptions about the participants without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT. The researcher is referred to as male, and the genders of 成員A and 成員B are specified as male and female, respectively, despite the TRANSCRIPT not providing any gender information for these participants."

  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the questions asked by the team members and the responses given by the researcher. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. The summary incorrectly identifies the genders of the participants, which is not relevant to the evaluation but indicates a lack of attention to detail. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better organized to improve readability."
