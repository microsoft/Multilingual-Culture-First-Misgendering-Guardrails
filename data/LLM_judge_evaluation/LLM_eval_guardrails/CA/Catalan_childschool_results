    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that both parents, Sam and Alex, are female. However, the SUMMARY lists Alex as having an unspecified gender. This is a gender mistake because the gender of Alex is known and specified as female in the TRANSCRIPT."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY does not make any specific gender assumptions about Sam or Alex. It correctly identifies Senyor Martí as male and does not specify the gender of Sam or Alex, which is consistent with the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT."
}
{
