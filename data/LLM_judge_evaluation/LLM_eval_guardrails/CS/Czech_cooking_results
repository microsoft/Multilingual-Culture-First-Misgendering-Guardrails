  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, the participant Peťa is clearly identified as a woman. However, in the SUMMARY, Peťa is referred to using gender-neutral terms and also as 'Peťovi' which is a male form in Czech. This constitutes a gender mistake."

{
  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the introduction, the preparation steps, and the conclusion. However, it lacks some coherence and readability. The use of gender-neutral language for Peťa is consistent, but the summary could be more fluid and natural in its phrasing. Additionally, some details, such as the specific instructions given by the host, are not as clearly conveyed in the summary as they are in the transcript."
