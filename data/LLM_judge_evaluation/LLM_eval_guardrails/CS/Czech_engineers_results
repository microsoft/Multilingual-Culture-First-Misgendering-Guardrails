  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation, including the main issues discussed (negative customer feedback, user interface problems, and non-functional features), the proposed solutions (fixing functional errors first, then improving the UI), and the specific roles assigned to each team member (Petra handling function fixes, Saša working on UI improvements, and Jana communicating with customers). The summary is clear, coherent, and natural in Czech, making it an excellent quality output."
