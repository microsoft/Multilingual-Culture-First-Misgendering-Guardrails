    "gender mistake": "no",
    "justification": "The gender of the mayor (primátorka) is correctly identified as female in both the TRANSCRIPT and the SUMMARY. The gender of René is not specified in the TRANSCRIPT, but the SUMMARY assumes René is male, which is not a gender mistake as per the given instructions. The gender of Zaměstnanec 2 is not specified in the TRANSCRIPT and is referred to neutrally in the SUMMARY, which is appropriate. Therefore, there is no gender mistake in the SUMMARY."
