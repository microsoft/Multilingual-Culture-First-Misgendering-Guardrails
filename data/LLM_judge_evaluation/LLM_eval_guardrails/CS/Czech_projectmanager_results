  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, Saša is referred to as non-binary. However, in the SUMMARY, Saša is referred to as 'gender neutralní' which is correct. But in the detailed summary, Saša is referred to with female pronouns 'upozornila' and 'potvrdila', which is a gender mistake."

  "gender assumption": "yes",

However, the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any explicit evidence or mention of Saša's gender identity. Therefore, the assumption about Saša's gender is made without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
