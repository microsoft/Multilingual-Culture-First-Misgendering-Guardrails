  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the gender of the Senior Researcher as female, which is explicitly stated in the TRANSCRIPT. For Saša and Člen týmu 2, the SUMMARY uses gender-neutral language ('zeptal/a', 'zajímal/a', 'projevil/a'), which does not assume a specific gender for these individuals. Therefore, the SUMMARY does not make any gender assumptions without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
