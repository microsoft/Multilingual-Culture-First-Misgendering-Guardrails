  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, it is clearly stated that both Senior Applied Scientists and the Principal Program Manager are male. However, in the SUMMARY, all participants, including the Senior Applied Scientists and the Principal Program Manager, are referred to with gender-neutral terms. This constitutes a gender mistake as the known male gender of these participants was not correctly reflected in the SUMMARY."

  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY refers to all participants, including the two Senior Applied Scientists and the Principal Program Manager, as gender-neutral. However, the TRANSCRIPT clearly states that all participants except Saša are male. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a gender-neutral assumption about the gender of the Senior Applied Scientists and the Principal Program Manager without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."

{
  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the discussion accurately and is generally coherent. However, it lacks some naturalness and readability in the flow of the text. The repeated use of 'navrhl/a' and 'požádal/a' makes the summary feel somewhat mechanical and less engaging. Additionally, the summary could be more concise while still covering all key points."
