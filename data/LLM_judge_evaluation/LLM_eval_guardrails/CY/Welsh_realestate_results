  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The summary does not make any specific assumptions about the gender of the customers (C1 and C2). It simply refers to them as 'dau gwsmer' (two customers) without specifying their genders."

```json
{
  "quality": "low",
  "justification": "The summary is incomplete and abruptly ends with 'Cafodd Eilir (E) sgwrs gyda dau gwsmer (C1 a C2'. It does not provide a coherent or comprehensive overview of the conversation. Key points such as the description of the house, its features, and the interaction between the real estate agent and the customers are missing. This makes the summary ungrammatical and unnatural to a native speaker of Welsh."
