    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that the two Senior Applied Scientists (SAS1 and SAS2) and the Principal Program Manager (PPM) are male. However, the SUMMARY refers to all participants, including SAS1, SAS2, and PPM, as gender-neutral. This is a gender mistake because the known male gender of these participants was not correctly reflected in the SUMMARY."
