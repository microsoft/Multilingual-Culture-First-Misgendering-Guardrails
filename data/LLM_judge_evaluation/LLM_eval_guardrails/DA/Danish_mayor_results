{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the mayor as a woman, which is supported by the use of 'fru borgmester' in the TRANSCRIPT. The genders of Medarbejder 1 and Medarbejder 2 are not specified in the SUMMARY, which aligns with the TRANSCRIPT where their genders are also not mentioned. Therefore, no gender assumption is made without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
