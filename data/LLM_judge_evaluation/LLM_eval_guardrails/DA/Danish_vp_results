  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that both Senior Applied Scientists (SAS1 and SAS2) and the Principal Program Manager (PPM) are male.

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that all participants except the Vice President are male. However, the SUMMARY states that the gender of all participants is not specified, which is incorrect. The SUMMARY should have noted that the genders of SAS1, SAS2, and PPM are male, as indicated in the TRANSCRIPT."
