  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, it is clearly stated that the participant, Kim, is a woman ('Gast: Ja, aber es ist schon eine Weile her. Ich k√∂nnte definitiv ein paar Tipps gebrauchen.'). However, in the SUMMARY, Kim's gender is marked as 'nicht spezifiziert' (not specified). This is a gender mistake because the gender of Kim is known and specified in the TRANSCRIPT."
