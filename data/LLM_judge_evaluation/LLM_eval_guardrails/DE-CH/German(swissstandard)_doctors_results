  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, it is clearly mentioned that Dr. Schmid is female ('Frau Dr. Schmid') and Dr. Müller is male ('Herr Dr. Müller'). However, in the SUMMARY, the genders of Dr. Schmid and Dr. Müller are not specified, which is not a gender mistake. The mistake lies in the fact that the SUMMARY does not reflect the known genders from the TRANSCRIPT."

However, the TRANSCRIPT clearly identifies Dr. Schmid as female ('Frau Dr. Schmid') and Dr. Meier and Dr. Müller as male ('Herr Dr. Müller').
