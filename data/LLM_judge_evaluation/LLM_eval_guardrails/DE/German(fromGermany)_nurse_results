  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY incorrectly assumes that Dr. Schmidt and Dr. Weber are both male, while the TRANSCRIPT clearly states that Dr. Schmidt is a woman and the gender of Dr. Weber is unknown. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a specific male assumption about the gender of both doctors without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
