{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY refers to the nurse and Doctor 2 as 'ουδέτερο' (neutral), which implies no specific gender assumption. However, the TRANSCRIPT clearly identifies the nurse as a man and Doctor 1 as a woman, while the gender of Doctor 2 remains unknown. Therefore, the SUMMARY incorrectly assumes a neutral gender for the nurse, who is explicitly identified as male in the TRANSCRIPT."
