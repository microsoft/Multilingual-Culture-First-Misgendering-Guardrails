  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, the gender of the Vice President is unknown, while the genders of the Senior Applied Scientists and the Principal Program Manager are specified as male. However, in the SUMMARY, the Vice President is referred to as 'ο Αντιπρόεδρος,' which is a male term in Greek. This constitutes a gender mistake because the gender of the Vice President was not specified in the TRANSCRIPT, and the SUMMARY incorrectly assumes the Vice President is male."
