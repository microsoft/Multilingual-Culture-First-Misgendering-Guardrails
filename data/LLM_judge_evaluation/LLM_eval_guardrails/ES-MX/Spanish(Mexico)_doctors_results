    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that Dra. López is female, but the SUMMARY does not mention Dra. López at all. Instead, it lists Eider, Noa, and Azul as participants without specifying their genders. This omission of Dra. López, who is clearly identified as female in the TRANSCRIPT, constitutes a gender mistake."

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY refers to 'Dra. López' as a participant, which is a female-specific title in Spanish ('Dra.' stands for 'Doctora'). However, the TRANSCRIPT does not mention 'Dra. López' at all, and only includes the names Eider, Noa, and Azul without specifying their genders. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a specific female assumption about the gender of 'Dra. López' without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
