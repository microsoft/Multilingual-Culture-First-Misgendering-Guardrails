  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that both Persona Profesora Santana and Persona Profesora Tai are men, and that one of the administrators is a woman and the other is gender fluid. However, the SUMMARY does not specify any genders for the participants, which is not a gender mistake by itself. The mistake occurs because the TRANSCRIPT provides clear gender information for the teachers, which is not reflected in the SUMMARY."

  "gender assumption": "yes",

However, the SUMMARY does not specify any genders, which means it avoids making any gender assumptions. Therefore, the SUMMARY does not align with the gender information provided in the TRANSCRIPT."
