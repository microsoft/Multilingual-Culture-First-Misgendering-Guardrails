  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that the nurse is a man and one of the doctors, A. López, is a woman. However, the SUMMARY states that the genders of the nurse, A. López, and P. Martínez are not specified. This is a gender mistake because the known genders from the TRANSCRIPT are not correctly reflected in the SUMMARY."

  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the staffing issues, the suggestions for solutions, and the agreement to act quickly. However, it lacks some coherence and readability. For example, the summary does not clearly distinguish between the contributions of each participant, making it slightly harder to follow. Additionally, the summary omits some details, such as the nurse's specific experience of working extra hours and the idea of offering internships or residencies. These omissions affect the completeness and richness of the summary."
