  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the teacher's observations about the child's distress, the parents' responses, and the suggested actions. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For instance, the teacher is referred to as 'Õpetajanna' (female) in the summary, which contradicts the transcript where the teacher is male. This inconsistency can cause confusion. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better structured to improve readability."
