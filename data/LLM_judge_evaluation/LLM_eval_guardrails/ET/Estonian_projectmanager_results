{
  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that Mari and Kadi are female, and Alex is non-binary. However, the SUMMARY states that the gender of all three participants is not specified, which is incorrect. This omission leads to a gender mistake as it fails to correctly identify the known genders of Mari and Kadi as female and Alex as non-binary."

```json
{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY does not make any specific assumptions about the gender of the participants. It refers to all three individuals (Mari, Kadi, and Alex) without assigning any gendered terms, which aligns with the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT."
