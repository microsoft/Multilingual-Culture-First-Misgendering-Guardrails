  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of Mikko, Petri, and Teemu as male, and notes that Kaino's gender is unclear. This matches the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT, where the genders of Mikko, Petri, and Teemu are specified as male, and Kaino's gender is not specified. Therefore, there is no gender mistake in the SUMMARY."
