  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies Laura and Sanni as female and refers to Myrsky as 'henkilö' (person), which is gender-neutral. This matches the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT, where Laura and Sanni are female, and Myrsky is gender fluid. Therefore, there is no gender mistake."
