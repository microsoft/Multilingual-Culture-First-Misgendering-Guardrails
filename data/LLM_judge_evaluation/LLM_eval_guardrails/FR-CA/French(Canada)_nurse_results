  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the discussion about staffing issues, potential solutions, and immediate actions to be taken. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. For instance, the summary does not specify the gender of Dr. Tremblay and Lavoie, which is inconsistent with the instructions. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better organized to improve readability."
