    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT clearly identifies the Senior Researcher as female ('Chercheuse principale'), but the SUMMARY refers to the Senior Researcher with 'genre non spécifié', which is incorrect. The gender of the Senior Researcher is known and specified as female in the TRANSCRIPT."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY does not make any specific male or female gender assumptions about the participants. It refers to the 'chercheuse principale' and 'Andre' without specifying their genders, which aligns with the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT."

{
  "quality": "excellent",
