{
  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, it is specified that Roland (SAS1) and Adelle (SAS2) are male. However, in the SUMMARY, their genders are marked as non-specified. This discrepancy constitutes a gender mistake because the known male gender of Roland and Adelle was not correctly reflected in the SUMMARY."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY incorrectly states that the genders of Roland, Sylvie, and Adelle are unspecified, while the TRANSCRIPT clearly indicates that Roland is male and Sylvie and Adelle are female. This shows that the SUMMARY makes a specific assumption about the gender of these participants without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
