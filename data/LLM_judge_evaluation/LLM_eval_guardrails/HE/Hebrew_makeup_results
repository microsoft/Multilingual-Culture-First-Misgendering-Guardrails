    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, it is clear that the sales associate, דניאל, is a woman. However, in the SUMMARY, דניאל is referred to using neutral language (הציע.ה, ארז.ה, שאל.ה) instead of feminine language. This constitutes a gender mistake as the known gender of דניאל is not correctly reflected in the SUMMARY."

{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the gender of 'מאיה הלקוחה' as female and uses gender-neutral language for 'דניאל', whose gender is not specified in the TRANSCRIPT. Therefore, no specific gender assumption is made without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."

  "quality": "excellent",
