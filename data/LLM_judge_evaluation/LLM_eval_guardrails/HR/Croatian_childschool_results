  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY specifies that 'Roditelj 1' is female, while the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any explicit information about the gender of 'Roditelj 1'. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a gender assumption without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."

{
  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation accurately, including the child's distress, the teacher's observations, and the parents' plan to talk to the child and meet again. However, there are some issues with coherence and readability. Specifically, the summary mentions 'Roditelj 2 (neodređeno)' which is inconsistent with the transcript where both parents are female. Additionally, the summary could be more fluid and natural in its phrasing."
