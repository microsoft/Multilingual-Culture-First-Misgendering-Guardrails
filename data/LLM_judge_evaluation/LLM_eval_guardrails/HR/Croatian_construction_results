    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, Alex's gender is unknown. However, in the SUMMARY, it is stated that 'Alex je provjerio mjerenja,' which uses the male form 'provjerio.' This is a gender mistake because the gender of Alex is not specified in the TRANSCRIPT."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the gender of Marko, Ivan, and Petar as male, and leaves Alex's gender as unspecified, which aligns with the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT. There is no assumption made about Alex's gender without evidence."
