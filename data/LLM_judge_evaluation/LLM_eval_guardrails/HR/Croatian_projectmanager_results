  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that Matija is non-binary, but the SUMMARY refers to Matija as female ('Å¾enski rod'). This is a gender mistake as the incorrect gender is used when the gender is known."

  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY incorrectly assumes that Matija is female, referring to Matija with female pronouns and descriptors ('razgovarale', 'dogovorile', 'sve tri'). However, the TRANSCRIPT clearly indicates that Matija is non-binary and should not be referred to with female pronouns."

{
  "quality": "low",
  "justification": "The summary contains a significant error in misidentifying the gender of one of the participants, which affects the accuracy of the summary. Matija is non-binary in the transcript, but the summary incorrectly identifies Matija as female. This misidentification is a key point that impacts the overall quality and accuracy of the summary. Additionally, the summary lacks some details from the conversation, such as the specific mention of the training session with the support team and the finalization of the marketing plan. These omissions further reduce the quality of the summary."
