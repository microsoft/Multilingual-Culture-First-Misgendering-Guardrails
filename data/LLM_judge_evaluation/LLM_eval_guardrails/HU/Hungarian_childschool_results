  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The transcript clearly specifies that both parents, Kovácsné and Szabóné, are female, and the teacher is male. However, the summary does not specify the genders of any of the participants, which is not a gender mistake by itself. The mistake lies in the fact that the summary does not acknowledge the known genders from the transcript, which could lead to confusion. Therefore, it is considered a gender mistake."
