  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the staffing issues, the difficulty in finding qualified personnel, and the proposed solutions such as collaboration with other institutions, offering scholarships, flexible working hours, and community support. However, the summary lacks some coherence and readability. For instance, it does not clearly distinguish between the contributions of the nurse and the doctors, and it omits some details like the nurse's concern about the current overload and the doctors' acknowledgment of the community's role in recruitment. Additionally, the summary's structure could be improved for better flow and clarity."
