  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the discussion about the launch date, testing progress, user feedback, and coordination with the marketing team. However, it lacks some details that were present in the transcript, such as the specific mention of the final steps and the encouragement to share any concerns about future projects. Additionally, the summary is somewhat repetitive and could be more concise and coherent. Overall, it is readable and understandable but could be improved for better clarity and completeness."
