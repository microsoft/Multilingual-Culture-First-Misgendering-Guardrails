    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that the nurse is a man and one of the doctors (의사 1) is a woman. However, the SUMMARY refers to all participants, including the nurse and 의사 1, as gender-neutral. This is a gender mistake because the known genders were not correctly reflected in the SUMMARY."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY incorrectly assumes that all participants are gender-neutral, while the TRANSCRIPT clearly identifies the nurse as a man and one of the doctors as a woman. The gender of the second doctor is indeed unknown, but the SUMMARY fails to reflect the known genders of the nurse and the first doctor."

  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY accurately captures the key points discussed in the TRANSCRIPT, including the challenges of staffing, the difficulty in finding qualified medical personnel, and the proposed solutions such as internship programs and community support initiatives. The summary is coherent, readable, and natural in Korean. It effectively conveys the essence of the conversation without omitting any significant details."
