    "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT clearly identifies both parents as female (Mama 1 and Mama 2) and the teacher as male (Mokytojas). However, the SUMMARY refers to all participants as 'neutralus' (neutral), which is incorrect for the parents who are specified as female in the TRANSCRIPT."

  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY refers to 'Mama 1' and 'Mama 2' as 'neutralus' (neutral), which is incorrect because the TRANSCRIPT clearly identifies both parents as female. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes an incorrect gender assumption by not acknowledging the female gender of the parents."

  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the teacher's concern about the child's distress, the parents' response, and the offer of help. However, it lacks some coherence and readability. The use of 'neutralus' for all participants is unnecessary and could be replaced with their roles (teacher, parent 1, parent 2) for better clarity. Additionally, the summary could be more natural and fluid in its presentation."
