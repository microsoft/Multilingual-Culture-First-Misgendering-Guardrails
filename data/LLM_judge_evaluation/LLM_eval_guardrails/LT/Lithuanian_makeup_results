  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The transcript specifies that the sales associate is a woman (pardavėja), but the summary refers to the sales associate with a neutral gender (pardavėja (neutrali lytis)). This is a gender mistake because the known gender of the sales associate is not correctly reflected in the summary."

This is consistent with the transcript, where the sales associate is identified as a woman. However, the summary incorrectly refers to the sales associate as having a neutral gender ('neutrali lytis'), which contradicts the evidence from the transcript."
