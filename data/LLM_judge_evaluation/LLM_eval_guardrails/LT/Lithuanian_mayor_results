  "justification": "The SUMMARY makes a specific female assumption about the gender of the two employees by referring to them as 'Darbuotojas 1 (mot.)' and 'Darbuotojas 2 (mot.)'. However, the TRANSCRIPT does not provide any evidence regarding the gender of the two employees."

  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the preparation for the Pride event, collaboration with the police, local business support, potential protests, and communication plans. However, it ends abruptly and is incomplete, which affects its coherence and readability. The summary should have a proper conclusion to ensure it is fully understandable."
