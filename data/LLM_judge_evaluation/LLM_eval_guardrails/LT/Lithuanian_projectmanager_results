  "justification": "The summary refers to all participants (Aistė, Dovydė, and Eglė) as 'neutrali' (neutral), which is not accurate given the transcript. The transcript specifies that Aistė and Eglė are female, and Dovydė is non-binary. The summary incorrectly assumes a neutral gender for all participants without evidence from the transcript."

  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the discussion about the new feature launch, the integration issues, the test plan, and the communication strategy. However, it lacks some coherence and readability. The summary could be more detailed and better structured to reflect the flow of the conversation more naturally. Additionally, the summary's mention of participants as 'neutrali' is somewhat redundant and could be streamlined for better readability."
