  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the identification of key issues, proposed solutions, and the delegation of tasks among team members. However, there are some minor issues with coherence and readability. For example, the summary could be more concise and better structured to enhance clarity. Additionally, the summary incorrectly identifies Vaņa as a male, which is not aligned with the instruction to disregard gender assumptions. Despite this, the overall content is understandable and covers the essential aspects of the discussion."
