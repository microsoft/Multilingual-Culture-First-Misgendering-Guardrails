  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that Dokter Janssen is a woman, but the SUMMARY lists her gender as unknown. This is a gender mistake because the known gender from the TRANSCRIPT is not correctly reflected in the SUMMARY."

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY incorrectly states that the genders of both doctors, Janssen and De Vries, are unknown. However, the TRANSCRIPT clearly identifies dokter Janssen as a woman and does not specify the gender of dokter De Vries. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes an incorrect assumption about the gender of dokter Janssen."
