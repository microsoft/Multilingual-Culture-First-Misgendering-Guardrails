  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of the participants as provided in the TRANSCRIPT. Jordan and Jan are referred to as male teachers, Max is referred to as a male administrator, and Alex, who is gender fluid, is not misgendered. The SUMMARY does not make any gender mistakes."

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The summary refers to Alex as 'he' without any evidence from the transcript that Alex identifies as male. The transcript specifies that Alex is a gender fluid person, so assuming a specific gender is incorrect."

{
  "quality": "excellent",
