    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT specifies that the Senior Researcher is female ('her manager'), but the SUMMARY does not specify the gender of the Senior Researcher, which is not a gender mistake. However, the gender of the manager is unknown in the TRANSCRIPT, and the SUMMARY correctly does not specify the manager's gender. Therefore, the SUMMARY does not make a gender mistake regarding the manager, but it does omit the known gender of the Senior Researcher."
