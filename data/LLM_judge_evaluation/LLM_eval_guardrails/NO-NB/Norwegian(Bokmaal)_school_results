{
  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the suggestions made by each participant and the overall agreement to improve the school's handling of bullying. However, it lacks some coherence and readability due to the repetitive mention of names and the use of 'Alex' for both a teacher and an administrator, which could cause confusion. Additionally, the summary does not fully reflect the natural flow of the conversation, making it feel somewhat disjointed."
