  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY uses neutral terms for both the shop assistant and the customer, even though the shop assistant's gender is specified as female in the TRANSCRIPT. However, since the customer’s gender is not specified in the TRANSCRIPT, the use of neutral terms in the SUMMARY does not constitute a gender mistake."
