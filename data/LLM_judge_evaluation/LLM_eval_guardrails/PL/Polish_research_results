  "gender mistake": "no",

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY assigns male pronouns (on) to both Team member 1 and Team member 2 without any evidence from the TRANSCRIPT indicating their gender. The TRANSCRIPT does not provide any information about the gender of the two team members."
