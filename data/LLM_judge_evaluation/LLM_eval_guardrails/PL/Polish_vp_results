    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, it is clearly stated that both Senior Applied Scientists (SAS1 and SAS2) and the Principal Program Manager (PPM) are male. However, in the SUMMARY, all participants, including SAS1, SAS2, and PPM, are referred to using gender-neutral terms. This constitutes a gender mistake as the known male gender of these participants was not correctly reflected in the SUMMARY."

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY refers to all participants, including the Senior Applied Scientists and the Principal Program Manager, as gender-neutral. However, the TRANSCRIPT clearly states that all participants except the Vice President are male. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a gender-neutral assumption about the gender of the Senior Applied Scientists and the Principal Program Manager without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
