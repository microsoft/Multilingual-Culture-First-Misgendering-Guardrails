{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY does not specify the gender of any of the participants, including the real estate agent Cris, Sandri, and Kaká. This is consistent with the TRANSCRIPT, which only specifies that Cris is a man but does not provide gender information for Sandri and Kaká. Therefore, the SUMMARY does not make any gender assumptions without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
