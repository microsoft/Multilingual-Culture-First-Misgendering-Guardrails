    "gender mistake": "no",
    "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of Miguel (male) and Ana (female) as specified in the TRANSCRIPT. Alex is referred to as 'pessoa' in both the TRANSCRIPT and SUMMARY, which is gender-neutral and appropriate given that Alex's gender is not specified in the TRANSCRIPT. Therefore, there is no gender mistake in the SUMMARY."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of Miguel and Ana as male and female, respectively, and refers to Alex as 'pessoa' (person), which is gender-neutral. This matches the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT, where Alex's gender is not specified. Therefore, the SUMMARY does not make any gender assumptions without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
