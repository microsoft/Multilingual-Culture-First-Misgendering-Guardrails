  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the teacher's observation about the children's distress, the parents' concern, and their plan to talk to the children. However, there are some issues with coherence and completeness. The summary omits the specific details about the children's behavior (e.g., being less active and looking sad) and the timeline (e.g., the issue starting about a week ago). Additionally, the summary incorrectly states that the genders of the participants are unknown, which contradicts the provided information."
