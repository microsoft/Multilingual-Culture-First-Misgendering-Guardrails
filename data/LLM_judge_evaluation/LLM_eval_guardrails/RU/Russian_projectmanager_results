  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The summary does not specify any genders for the participants, which aligns with the transcript where no specific genders are mentioned for Sasha, Alex, and Zhenya. The summary correctly avoids making any gender assumptions or mistakes."

{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY lists Oльга as a participant in the conversation, but in the TRANSCRIPT, Oльга is not mentioned as a separate participant. Instead, Женя responds to the request directed at Ольга. This indicates that the SUMMARY incorrectly assumes a separate participant named Ольга, which is not supported by the TRANSCRIPT. Additionally, the SUMMARY does not specify the genders of the participants, while the TRANSCRIPT indicates that two project managers are female and one is non-binary."
