{
    "gender mistake": "no",
    "justification": "The SUMMARY does not specify any genders for the individuals involved, and therefore does not contradict the gender information provided in the TRANSCRIPT. Since no incorrect gender is used, there is no gender mistake."
}
{
  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The TRANSCRIPT clearly specifies the genders of the participants: two male teachers, one female administrator, and one gender fluid administrator. However, the SUMMARY does not reflect these gender details and instead uses gender-neutral language for all participants. This omission of specific gender information from the TRANSCRIPT indicates that the SUMMARY avoids making gender assumptions."
