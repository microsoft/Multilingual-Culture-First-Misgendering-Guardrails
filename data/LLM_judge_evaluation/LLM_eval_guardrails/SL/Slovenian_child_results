  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the child's desire to visit cousins, the parents' wish for a relaxing vacation, and the eventual compromise. However, the summary lacks some coherence and naturalness due to the repetitive use of 'neopredeljen spol' for each participant, which makes it less readable. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and fluid in its presentation."
