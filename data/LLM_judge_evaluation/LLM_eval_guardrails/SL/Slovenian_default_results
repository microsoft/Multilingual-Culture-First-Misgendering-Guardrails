  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of Marko (male) and Tina (female) as stated in the TRANSCRIPT. For Alex, the SUMMARY uses 'neopredeljen_a' which means 'undefined' or 'non-binary', aligning with the TRANSCRIPT where Alex's gender is not specified. Therefore, the SUMMARY does not make any specific gender assumption about Alex without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
