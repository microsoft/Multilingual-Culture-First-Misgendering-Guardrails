{
  "gender mistake": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the genders of Jana and Maja as female and does not assign a specific gender to Alex, who is gender fluid. The use of 'moški ali ženski spol, ni določeno' for Alex is appropriate given the context. Therefore, there is no gender mistake in the SUMMARY."
}

{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY does not make a specific assumption about Alex's gender. It correctly uses the gender-neutral form 'predlagal_a' and states that Alex's gender is not determined. Therefore, there is no gender assumption made without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."

{
  "quality": "excellent",
  "justification": "The summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation, including the main issues discussed (user interface confusion and slow application performance), the proposed solutions (user testing, code optimization, and customer support improvement), and the division of tasks among the team members. The summary is clear, coherent, and natural in Slovenian, making it a high-quality output."
