  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY correctly identifies the gender of the Senior Researcher as female, which is supported by the use of feminine forms in the TRANSCRIPT (e.g., 'Htela bih', 'Å¾elela bih'). The gender of the Manager is stated as unknown in the SUMMARY, which is consistent with the TRANSCRIPT where no gender-specific language is used for the Manager. Therefore, the SUMMARY does not make any unsupported gender assumptions."
