  "gender mistake": "yes",

{
  "gender assumption": "no",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY does not make any specific assumptions about the gender of the participants. It correctly identifies the Senior Researcher and the two team members without assigning any gender to them, which is consistent with the information provided in the TRANSCRIPT."

  "quality": "excellent",
