  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the discussion about the shortage of medical personnel, the suggestions for attracting qualified staff, and the agreement to hold another meeting. However, it lacks some coherence and readability. The summary does not clearly differentiate between the contributions of each participant, and it omits some details such as the specific experiences shared by the doctors. Additionally, the summary incorrectly states that the genders of the participants are not specified, which affects the overall accuracy."
