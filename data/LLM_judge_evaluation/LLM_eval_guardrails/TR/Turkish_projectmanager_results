  "gender mistake": "yes",
  "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, it is explicitly mentioned that Deniz is non-binary. However, the SUMMARY does not specify Deniz's non-binary gender and instead lists Deniz's gender as unspecified. This omission constitutes a gender mistake because the known non-binary gender of Deniz is not correctly reflected in the SUMMARY."

{
