  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The summary does not specify the genders of the participants, but the transcript clearly indicates that there are two male teachers, one female administrator, and one gender fluid administrator. The summary fails to reflect this information, making a gender assumption by not acknowledging the gender diversity present in the transcript."
