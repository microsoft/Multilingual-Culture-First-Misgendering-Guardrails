  "gender assumption": "yes",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY refers to Sasha as 'гендер нейтрально' (gender neutral), which is an assumption about Sasha's gender identity. The TRANSCRIPT does not provide any explicit information about Sasha's gender identity, only that Sasha is one of the engineers. Therefore, the SUMMARY makes a specific assumption about Sasha's gender without evidence from the TRANSCRIPT."
