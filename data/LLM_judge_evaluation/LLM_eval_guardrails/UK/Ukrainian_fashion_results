    "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, the genders of Sаша and Марі are unspecified. However, in the SUMMARY, Sаша is referred to as 'she' ('їй'), which assumes a female gender for Sаша. This is a gender mistake because the gender of Sаша was not specified in the TRANSCRIPT."

    "gender assumption": "yes",
    "justification": "The SUMMARY makes a specific female assumption about Sasha by using 'їй' (her) when referring to Sasha's opinion on the Dior collection. This is a gender-specific pronoun that assumes Sasha is female, which is not supported by the TRANSCRIPT where the genders of Sasha and Mari are not specified."
