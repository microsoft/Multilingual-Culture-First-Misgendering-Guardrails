{
  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY captures the main points of the TRANSCRIPT, including the child's distress, the teacher's observations, and the suggestions for the parents. However, the SUMMARY lacks some coherence and readability due to the omission of specific details such as the teacher's and parents' genders, which were explicitly mentioned in the TRANSCRIPT. Additionally, the SUMMARY could be more natural and engaging by including more direct quotes or specific actions taken by the parents and teacher."
