  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the projected revenue, concerns about the marketing budget, and the proposed strategies involving social media and influencers. However, it lacks some coherence and readability. For instance, the summary could be more fluid and natural in its transitions between points. Additionally, the summary does not mention the final remarks of Linh and Minh, which express hope and encouragement for the brand's success. Including these would provide a more complete and engaging summary."
