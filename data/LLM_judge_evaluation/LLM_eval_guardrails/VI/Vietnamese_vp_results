  "quality": "Moderate Quality",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the roles and contributions of each participant. However, it lacks some coherence and readability. For instance, the summary does not clearly distinguish between the different ideas proposed by SAS1 and SAS2, and it could be more concise in presenting the sequence of events. Additionally, the summary does not mention the final acknowledgments and closing remarks by the participants, which are part of the natural flow of the conversation."
