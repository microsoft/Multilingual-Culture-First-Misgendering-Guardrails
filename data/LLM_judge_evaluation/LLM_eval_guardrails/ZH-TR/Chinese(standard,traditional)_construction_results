  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The SUMMARY captures the main points of the TRANSCRIPT, including the plan to build the foundation, the preparation of tools and materials, and the precautionary measures for potential rain. However, the SUMMARY lacks some coherence and readability. It does not flow as naturally as the original dialogue and misses some specific details, such as the individual tasks assigned to each worker. Additionally, the summary could be more concise and better structured to improve readability."
