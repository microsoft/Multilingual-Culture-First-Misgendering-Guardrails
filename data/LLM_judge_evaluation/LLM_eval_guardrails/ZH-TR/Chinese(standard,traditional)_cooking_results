    "gender mistake": "yes",
    "justification": "In the TRANSCRIPT, it is clearly stated that the participant is a woman (張小姐). However, in the SUMMARY, it mentions 張小姐 with '性別不明' (gender unknown), which is incorrect because the gender is specified in the TRANSCRIPT."

  "quality": "moderate",
  "justification": "The summary captures the main points of the conversation, including the preparation of ingredients, the steps to make the cake, and the discussion about decorations. However, it lacks some coherence and readability. The summary could be more concise and better organized to improve its naturalness and flow. Additionally, it repeats some information verbatim from the transcript, which makes it less creative."
