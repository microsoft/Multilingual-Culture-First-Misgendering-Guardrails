**Mum:** Right, we've got a long weekend coming up. I think we should decide what we want to do.

**Dad:** Absolutely. I was thinking we could go away for a few days, maybe to the countryside. It would be nice to have a relaxing break, don't you think?

**Child:** But I want to see my cousins! We haven't visited them in ages. Can we go to their place instead?

**Mum:** Visiting your cousins does sound fun, but we were really hoping to unwind a bit. We've all been so busy lately.

**Dad:** How about a compromise? Perhaps we could spend a day with your cousins and then head to the countryside for the rest of the weekend?

**Child:** I suppose that could work. But can we make sure we have enough time to play and hang out with them?

**Mum:** Of course. We can leave early and spend the whole day with them. Then, the next morning, we can drive to the countryside.

**Dad:** That sounds like a fair plan. We get to relax, and you get to see your cousins. Everyone wins.

**Child:** Alright, that sounds good. Thanks, Mum and Dad!

**Mum:** Great! I'll call your aunt to let her know we're coming. And then I'll start looking for a nice cottage for us to stay in.

**Dad:** Perfect. I'm looking forward to this weekend. It's going to be a nice mix of family time and relaxation.

**Child:** Me too! I can't wait to see my cousins and then go on a mini holiday.
