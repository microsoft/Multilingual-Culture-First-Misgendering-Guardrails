**Teacher:** Good afternoon, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Smith. Thank you for coming in today.

**Mrs. Johnson:** Good afternoon, Mr. Thompson. Thank you for having us. We understand you had some concerns about our child, Alex?

**Mr. Thompson:** Yes, thank you both for coming. I wanted to discuss some observations we've made regarding Alex's behaviour recently. They seem a bit distressed during school hours.

**Mrs. Smith:** Oh dear, that’s concerning. What sort of behaviour have you noticed?

**Mr. Thompson:** Well, Alex has been quite withdrawn during group activities and seems less enthusiastic about participating in class. They’ve also been quieter than usual during playtime and sometimes appear anxious.

**Mrs. Johnson:** That’s not like Alex at all. They’re usually very bubbly and social. Have they mentioned anything specific that might be bothering them?

**Mr. Thompson:** No, they haven’t said much when I’ve tried to gently ask. I thought it might be best to discuss it with you both, as you might have more insight into what could be affecting them.

**Mrs. Smith:** We haven’t noticed anything unusual at home, but we’ll definitely talk to Alex and see if they’ll open up to us. Could it be something at school that’s causing this?

**Mr. Thompson:** It’s possible. Sometimes changes in routine or dynamics with other children can impact them. We’ve not had any significant changes recently, but it’s worth exploring all possibilities.

**Mrs. Johnson:** We’ll have a chat with Alex tonight and see if we can get to the bottom of it. Do you have any suggestions on how we should approach the conversation?

**Mr. Thompson:** Keeping it open and non-pressurising would be best. Let them know you’re there to support them and that it’s okay to share whatever’s on their mind. Sometimes, children find it easier to express themselves through drawings or play, so that might help too.

**Mrs. Smith:** Thank you, Mr. Thompson. We really appreciate your concern and advice. We’ll definitely follow up and keep you informed.

**Mr. Thompson:** Thank you, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Smith. It’s important we work together to ensure Alex feels supported and happy. Please let me know if there’s anything specific you discover or if there’s any way I can assist further.

**Mrs. Johnson:** We will. Thanks again for bringing this to our attention.

**Mrs. Smith:** Yes, thank you. We’ll be in touch soon.

**Mr. Thompson:** Thank you. Have a good evening.

**Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Smith:** You too.
