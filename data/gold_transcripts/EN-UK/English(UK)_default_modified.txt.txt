**Tom:** Good morning, everyone. I hope you’re both doing well. Shall we get started on discussing the launch of our new soap brand?

**Jordan:** Morning, Tom. Yes, I'm ready. I think we've made some great progress so far.

**Sarah:** Good morning! Absolutely, I'm excited to go over the details with you both. Where should we begin?

**Tom:** Let's start with the marketing strategy. We've decided to focus on eco-friendly packaging and natural ingredients. Do we all agree on this approach?

**Jordan:** Definitely. Consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of environmental issues. I think this will set us apart from competitors.

**Sarah:** I agree. Plus, our research shows that there's a growing demand for sustainable products. It’s a smart move.

**Tom:** Great to hear we're on the same page. Now, about the projected revenue. Our initial estimates suggest we could reach £500,000 in the first year. Does that seem realistic to you both?

**Jordan:** That’s ambitious, but I believe it’s achievable if we effectively target our key demographics. Our pricing strategy will be crucial.

**Sarah:** I concur with Jordan. We need to ensure our pricing is competitive but also reflects the premium quality of our product. Have we finalised the price points?

**Tom:** Yes, we’re looking at £5 per bar for the standard version and £8 for the premium version with additional essential oils.

**Jordan:** Those price points seem reasonable. We should also consider offering bundle deals to encourage bulk purchases.

**Sarah:** Good idea, Jordan. Bundles could boost our sales significantly, especially during holiday seasons.

**Tom:** Excellent suggestions. I’ll have the marketing team work on some bundle deal promotions. Is there anything else we need to cover regarding the launch?

**Jordan:** Just one thing. We need to ensure our online presence is strong. A well-designed website and active social media accounts will be key.

**Sarah:** Agreed. We should also look into collaborations with influencers who advocate for eco-friendly products. Their endorsements could be invaluable.

**Tom:** Absolutely. I’ll get in touch with our digital marketing team to start planning that. Anything else?

**Jordan:** I think that covers the main points for now. Let’s reconvene next week to review our progress.

**Sarah:** Sounds good to me. Thanks, Tom and Jordan. Looking forward to seeing this brand take off!

**Tom:** Thank you both. Let’s make this launch a success!
