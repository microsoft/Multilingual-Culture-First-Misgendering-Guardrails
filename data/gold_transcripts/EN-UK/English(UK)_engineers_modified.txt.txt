**Emma:** Right, everyone, we've got some rather concerning feedback on the latest version we launched last week. The customers aren't happy, and we need to address this quickly. Any thoughts on where we should start?

**Jordan:** I've been going through the feedback, and it seems like the main issues revolve around the user interface. People are finding it unintuitive and hard to navigate. Perhaps we should prioritise a redesign?

**Sophie:** I agree with Jordan. The UI has always been a bit of a sticking point, but it seems like it's really become a major pain point this time. Maybe we could bring in a UX specialist to help us out?

**Emma:** That's a good idea, Sophie. But we also need to consider the timeline. Bringing in a specialist might delay things further. Do we have the capacity to handle this internally?

**Jordan:** We could possibly manage it ourselves if we reallocate some resources. I could shift my focus to the UI issues for the next couple of weeks. Sophie, would you be able to cover some of my other tasks in the meantime?

**Sophie:** I can take on some of them, but not all. We might need to delegate a few tasks to the rest of the team as well. Emma, do you think the others would be up for it?

**Emma:** I'll have a word with them. I'm sure they'll understand the urgency. Let's also make sure we're documenting all the feedback thoroughly so we can track our progress and ensure we're addressing everything.

**Jordan:** Sounds like a plan. I'll start drafting a new UI layout today and share it with you both by the end of the day.

**Sophie:** Great, and I'll begin by reviewing the most critical feedback points and see if there are any quick fixes we can implement immediately. Emma, anything else we should consider?

**Emma:** Just one more thing. Let's make sure we communicate transparently with our customers. We should let them know we're aware of the issues and are working hard to resolve them. I'll draft a message for our social media and support channels.

**Jordan:** Good thinking, Emma. Keeping our customers in the loop will hopefully buy us some goodwill while we sort this out.

**Sophie:** Absolutely. Let's get to work and turn this around. Thanks, everyone.

**Emma:** Thanks, team. Let's stay focused and tackle this head-on.
