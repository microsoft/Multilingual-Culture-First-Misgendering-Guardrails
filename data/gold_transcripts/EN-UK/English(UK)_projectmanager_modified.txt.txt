**Emma:** Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining this meeting on short notice. I hope you've all had a chance to look at the latest updates on the new feature launch.

**Jordan:** Morning, Emma. I went through the updates last night. There are a few points I think we need to address before we can move forward.

**Sarah:** Morning. I agree, Jordan. Specifically, I'm concerned about the integration with the existing systems. Our beta testers have reported some compatibility issues that we need to iron out.

**Emma:** Absolutely, Sarah. Those compatibility issues are critical. Jordan, do you have any suggestions on how we might tackle them?

**Jordan:** Yes, I think we should arrange a dedicated session with the development and QA teams to go over these issues in detail. It might also help to have a few of the beta testers join us to give firsthand feedback.

**Sarah:** That sounds like a solid plan. We should also consider extending the beta testing period if the issues are significant. We don't want to launch with any major bugs.

**Emma:** Agreed. We need to ensure the feature is seamless before the official launch. How about we schedule the session for tomorrow afternoon? Does that work for everyone?

**Jordan:** Tomorrow afternoon works for me. I'll coordinate with the development and QA teams to ensure they can attend.

**Sarah:** Same here. I'll reach out to the beta testers and see who can join us. We should have a list of specific issues ready for the meeting.

**Emma:** Great. Let's aim to have a detailed discussion and come up with a clear action plan. Anything else we need to cover today?

**Jordan:** Just a quick note on the marketing side. Once we have a clearer timeline, we should sync with the marketing team to adjust our promotional activities accordingly.

**Sarah:** Good point, Jordan. I'll make a note to update the marketing team once we finalise the new timeline.

**Emma:** Excellent. Thanks, everyone. Let's regroup tomorrow with all the necessary stakeholders. Have a productive day!

**Jordan:** Thanks, Emma. See you all tomorrow.

**Sarah:** Thanks, everyone. See you tomorrow.
