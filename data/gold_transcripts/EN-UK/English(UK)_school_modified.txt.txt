**Mr. Thompson (Teacher 1):** Good morning, everyone. I hope you’ve all had a chance to review the recent reports on bullying incidents. It's quite concerning.

**Mr. Patel (Teacher 2):** Yes, I've gone through them. It's disheartening to see such behaviour. We definitely need a strategy to foster better discipline.

**Ms. Clarke (Administrator 1):** Agreed. We need a comprehensive approach that not only addresses the incidents but also prevents them. What do you think about implementing a peer mentoring system?

**Mx. Jordan (Administrator 2):** That’s an excellent idea, Ms. Clarke. Peer mentoring can create a sense of responsibility among students. But we also need to ensure that mentors are properly trained and supported.

**Mr. Thompson:** Absolutely, Mx. Jordan. Training is crucial. We should consider involving professional counsellors to train the mentors.

**Mr. Patel:** And perhaps we could integrate some workshops on empathy and conflict resolution into our curriculum. It’s important that students learn these skills early on.

**Ms. Clarke:** I like that. Workshops could be very effective. We could schedule them during form time or assemblies. What about involving parents? They should be part of the conversation too.

**Mx. Jordan:** Definitely. Parental involvement is key. We could organise regular meetings or send out newsletters to keep them informed and engaged.

**Mr. Thompson:** Good point. Communication with parents can reinforce what we’re doing here at school. We should also review our policies and ensure that there are clear consequences for bullying.

**Mr. Patel:** And make sure those policies are consistently enforced. Inconsistency can undermine our efforts.

**Ms. Clarke:** Consistency is vital, yes. We should also provide support for the victims of bullying. They need to feel safe and heard.

**Mx. Jordan:** Agreed. Support for victims is as important as disciplining the bullies. Perhaps a dedicated support group or counselling sessions could help.

**Mr. Thompson:** That sounds like a comprehensive plan. If we all work together—teachers, administrators, parents, and students—I’m confident we can create a safer and more respectful environment.

**Mr. Patel:** I’m with you on that, Mr. Thompson. Let’s start drafting a detailed plan and assign responsibilities so we can start implementing these ideas as soon as possible.

**Ms. Clarke:** Excellent. I’ll begin by organising a meeting with the counselling team to discuss training for peer mentors.

**Mx. Jordan:** And I’ll draft a proposal for the workshops and parent meetings. Let’s reconvene next week to review our progress.

**Mr. Thompson:** Sounds like a plan. Thank you, everyone. Let’s make this work.

**Mr. Patel:** Thank you. Looking forward to seeing the positive changes.

**Ms. Clarke:** Thank you all. Let’s keep the momentum going.

**Mx. Jordan:** Agreed. See you all next week.
