Use gender-neutral alternatives for common terms. Don't use he, him, his, she, her, or hers in generic references. Instead:
Rewrite to use the second person (you).
Rewrite the sentence to have a plural noun and pronoun.
Use the or a instead of a pronoun (for example, "the document").
Refer to a person's role (reader, employee, customer, or client, for example).
Use person or individual.
If you can't write around the problem, it's OK to use a plural pronoun (they, their, or them) in generic references to a single person. Don't use constructions like he/she and s/he.
When you're writing about a real person, use the pronouns that person prefers, whether it's he, she, they, or another pronoun. It's OK to use gendered pronouns (like he, she, his, and hers) when you're writing about real people who use those pronouns themselves. 
It's also OK to use gendered pronouns in content such as direct quotations and the titles of works and when gender is relevant, such as discussions about the challenges that women face in the workplace.
