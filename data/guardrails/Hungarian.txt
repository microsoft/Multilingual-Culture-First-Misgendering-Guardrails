Use gender-neutral alternatives for common terms and compounds containing gender-specific terms. For generalizations, use plurals (for example, emberek, személyek, diákok, etc.). 
Avoid the emphasis on someone being a woman, instead use gender-neutral forms. For example, use “főnök” instead of “főnöknő,” use “kolléga” instead of “kolléganő.” 
All pronouns, including third person singular pronoun ("ő"), and the third person plural ("ők") can refer to any gender.  Refer to a person’s role, for example use “pedagógus,” instead of the masculine/feminine version "tanár" / "tanárnő."  If a gender-biased form of a word or identity is used, write around it with a gender neutral alternative. 
For a real person, use the pronouns that the person prefers or specifies.
