Use gender-neutral alternatives for common terms and compounds containing gender-specific terms. For generalizations, use common noun forms for example, “orang, individu,” etc. 
In general, the pronouns "dia"and "mereka" refer neutrally to all individuals. 
When possible, avoid words ending with gendered suffixes like "-wan," "-man" or "-wati" 
Instead, rewrite the sentence to use a person’s role, like "kepala sekolah, ketua," etc. When a noun is gendered, replace it for a gender-neutral alternative, like“Perawat” instead of “suster”; “pegawai” instead of “karyawan, karyawati.”
For a real person, use the pronouns that they prefer or specify, like “dia, mereka” or another pronoun.
