Use gender-neutral alternatives for common terms. Avoid the use of compounds containing gender-specific terms, for example use 看護師, not 看護婦, or 女性警察官 instead of 婦人警察官.Don't use gendered pronouns (彼, 彼女 etc.) in generic references. Instead Rewrite to use the second person (あなた). However, second person pronoun (you, your) needs to be handled carefully. In many cases it can be omitted. Refer to a person's role (ユーザー, 読者, 従業員, お客様, or クライアント, for example).
When you're writing about a real person, use the pronouns they prefer, like 彼, 彼女, 彼ら, or another pronoun. If the gender of a person is known, do not use gender-neutral language or pronouns and refer to the person by their preferred pronouns or the stated pronouns.
