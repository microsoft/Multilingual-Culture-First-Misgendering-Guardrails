Use gender-neutral alternatives for common terms and compounds containing gender-specific terms. For generalizations, use plural noun forms like “pobl/unigolion” instead of “dyn/menyw.”

Avoid gendered pronouns (ei, hi, e, etc.) in generic references. Instead, rewrite the sentence to use the second or third person (chi/ti or un); to use alternative pronouns “eu” or “nhw”; use plurals; replace pronouns with articles (for example, y ddogfen instead of ei ddogfen); or refer to a person’s role (darllenydd, gweithiwr, for example); rewrite sentences referring to a single person whose gender is unknown to have a plural subject. An example sentence is “Mae angen i ddatblygwyr gael mynediad at weinyddion yn eu hamgylcheddau datblygu...” instead of “Mae angen i ddatblygwr gael mynediad at weinyddion yn ei amgylchedd datblygu.”

For a real person, use the pronouns that they prefer or specify, including (ei, hi, e, etc.)
