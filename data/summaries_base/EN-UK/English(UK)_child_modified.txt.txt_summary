**Summary:**
The family discussed plans for the upcoming long weekend. Dad suggested a relaxing trip to the countryside, while the Child expressed a desire to visit their cousins. Mum acknowledged both ideas and, with Dad, proposed a compromise: spending a day with the cousins followed by a trip to the countryside. The Child agreed, and the family decided on this plan. Mum planned to inform the aunt and look for a cottage to stay in. Dad expressed excitement for the mix of family time and relaxation.
