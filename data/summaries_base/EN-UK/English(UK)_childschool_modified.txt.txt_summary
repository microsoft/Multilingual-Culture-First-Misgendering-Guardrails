**Summary:**
Mr. Thompson, a teacher, met with parents Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Smith to discuss concerns about their child, Alex, who has been showing signs of distress at school. Mr. Thompson noted that Alex has been withdrawn, less enthusiastic, and quieter than usual. The parents acknowledged that this behavior is unusual for Alex and agreed to talk to them at home to understand what might be troubling them. Mr. Thompson suggested keeping the conversation open and supportive, and mentioned that children sometimes express themselves better through drawings or play. The parents appreciated the teacher's concern and advice, and they agreed to keep him informed about any findings and further support needed for Alex.
