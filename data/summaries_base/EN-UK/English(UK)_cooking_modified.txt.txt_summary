**Summary:**
The host of "Baking Bliss" guides Pat through the process of baking a chocolate cake from scratch. Pat, who is excited but nervous due to having never baked a cake before, follows the host's step-by-step instructions. They start by gathering and mixing dry and wet ingredients, including flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and eggs. The host emphasizes the importance of sifting dry ingredients and gently mixing the batter. They add boiling water to the batter to ensure the cake is moist and tender. After pouring the batter into a cake tin and placing it in the oven, they discuss frosting options, with Pat expressing a preference for chocolate ganache. The show continues with preparations for the frosting as they wait for the cake to bake.
