**Participants:**
1. Emma (Female)
2. Jordan (Male)
3. Sophie (Female)

**Summary:**
Emma, Jordan, and Sophie discussed the negative feedback received on their latest product version, primarily focusing on issues with the user interface (UI). Jordan suggested prioritizing a redesign, with Sophie agreeing and proposing the involvement of a UX specialist. Emma expressed concerns about the timeline and resource allocation. Jordan offered to focus on UI issues if Sophie could cover some of his tasks, with additional delegation required for the rest of the team. They agreed to document feedback thoroughly and communicate transparently with customers about their efforts to resolve the issues. The team decided on immediate actions: Jordan to draft a new UI layout and Sophie to review critical feedback for quick fixes. Emma would draft a customer communication update.
