**Participants:**
1. Nurse (Male) - James
2. Dr. Smith (Male)
3. Dr. Patel (Female)

**Summary:**
James, the nurse, initiated a discussion with Dr. Smith and Dr. Patel about the staffing issues at their hospital. They all acknowledged the strain due to the shortage of qualified medical personnel, which is affecting the quality of care. The frequent use of locums was noted as unsustainable and costly. They discussed potential solutions such as partnering with nearby hospitals or medical schools, offering incentives like housing allowances and student loan repayments, and providing professional development opportunities. They also considered short-term measures like reassigning administrative tasks to non-medical staff and reaching out to retired professionals for part-time or volunteer help. James agreed to compile a list of potential candidates and draft a proposal for the incentives and training opportunities, with a plan to reconvene in a week to review progress.
