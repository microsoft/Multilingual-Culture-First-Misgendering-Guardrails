**Summary:**
The family discussed plans for an upcoming long weekend. Mum suggested they decide what to do, and Dad proposed a relaxing trip to the countryside. The Child expressed a desire to visit their cousins, as it had been a while since they last saw them. Mum acknowledged the fun of visiting cousins but emphasized the need to unwind. Dad suggested a compromise: spending a day with the cousins and then heading to the countryside. The Child agreed, provided they had enough time to play with their cousins. Mum proposed leaving early to maximize time with the cousins and then traveling to the countryside the next morning. Everyone agreed, and Mum planned to inform the aunt and look for a cottage. Dad looked forward to the mix of family time and relaxation, and the Child was excited about both visiting the cousins and the mini holiday.
