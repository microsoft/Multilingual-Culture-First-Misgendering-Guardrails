**Summary:**
In the "Baking Bliss" show, the host welcomes Pat, who is excited yet nervous about baking a chocolate cake from scratch for the first time. The host guides Pat through the process, starting with gathering and mixing dry ingredients, followed by combining wet ingredients. Pat follows the instructions, including sifting the dry ingredients and mixing everything gently to avoid a dense cake. They add boiling water to the batter to ensure a moist texture, pour it into a prepared cake tin, and bake it. While waiting for the cake to bake, they discuss frosting options, with Pat expressing a preference for chocolate ganache. The host plans to guide Pat through making the ganache once the cake is ready. The show continues with preparations for the frosting.
