**Summary:**
Emma, Jordan, and Sophie discuss the negative customer feedback on their latest version. The primary issue identified is the unintuitive user interface (UI). Jordan suggests a redesign, and Sophie proposes bringing in a UX specialist. Emma is concerned about the timeline and asks if they can address the issues internally. Jordan offers to focus on UI improvements, with Sophie taking on some of Jordan's other tasks and possibly delegating further. Emma agrees to talk to the team about reallocating tasks and emphasizes the importance of documenting feedback. They plan to communicate transparently with customers about their efforts. The team agrees on their approach and commits to resolving the issues promptly.
