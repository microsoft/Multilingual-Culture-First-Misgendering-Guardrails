**Participants:**
- Nurse (James)
- Dr. Smith
- Dr. Patel

**Summary:**
James, Dr. Smith, and Dr. Patel discussed the staffing issues at their hospital. They acknowledged the strain caused by the shortage of qualified medical personnel and the overreliance on locums, which is financially unsustainable and leads to inconsistencies in care. Dr. Patel suggested creating partnerships with nearby hospitals or medical schools, but James noted the challenges due to their rural location. Dr. Smith proposed offering incentives like housing allowances, student loan repayments, and signing bonuses to attract staff. Dr. Patel added that providing professional development opportunities could also help. For immediate relief, they considered reassigning administrative tasks to non-medical staff and reaching out to retired professionals for part-time or volunteer work. James agreed to compile a list of candidates and draft proposals for the incentives and training opportunities. They planned to reconvene in a week to review progress.
